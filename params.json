Include and lib are in the repo for VS2013 - if you have any other compiler, drop the SFML and jsoncpp include directories in the project's include directories, and do the same for the lib, and it should compile; make sure to switch the dlls out as well. \r\n\r\nIt has been tested on VS2013 and VS2015 - just switch out the libs/dlls for the corresponding ones for your compiler.\r\n\r\n### Controls\r\nControls are very similar to the editor it's based on, with a few changes.\r\nPanning works without a mouse.\r\n\r\n- **Mouse controls**\r\n  - Left click: Place point/select point\r\n  - Right click: Select polygon with center nearest to mouse\r\n  - Middle (scrollwheel) click: Pan camera\r\n- **Keyboard controls**\r\n  - S: Save image \r\n  - **Camera**\r\n    - LControl: Identical to middle mouse - pan camera while held\r\n    - Arrow keys: Move camera\r\n    - +/-: Zoom\r\n  - **Editor toggles**\r\n    - W: Wireframe mode, only show colored outlines\r\n    - H: Hide/show background image\r\n    - X: Hide/show polygon centers (useful for seeing density/distribution and easier selection)\r\n    - P: Hide/show polygon points\r\n  - **Selection tools** \r\n    - Delete: Delete selection\r\n    - Space: Clear selection\r\n    - **Coloring tools**\r\n      - A: Reaverage polygon color (useful for small changes that keep the same general color but add slight change)\r\n      - O: Change polygon color to color at mouse point\r\n      - C: Open color picker to select color\r\n    - **Overlapping**\r\n      - Comma: Send selection to back\r\n      - Period: Send selection to front\r\n\r\n**Antialiasing levels** are supported, just launch the exe with a number after it for the AA level.  \r\n\r\nExample:  \r\n    polyedit 8\r\nfor 8x AA.\r\n  \r\n### Platforms\r\nIt *theoretically* should work on all platforms, however it's only been tested on windows.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nResizing is supported and should work but occasionally glitches.  \r\nImages are saved on exit.  \r\nAny point outside the boundary has the color of the closest in-image-boundary point - triangles made outside the image bounds should get correct colors.  \r\nSaving pushes all out-of-bounds points inbound.  \r\nThe editor only recognizes the vertices file if it is in the same directory as the image with the same name.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nMIT License.\r\n",
